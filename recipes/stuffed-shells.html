        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add shells and
                cook, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes until tender. Drain,
                rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix together cottage cheese, mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese,
                eggs, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Rub oregano and parsley between
                your palms to pulverize them, then stir into cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Stuff cheese mixture into pasta shells.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 of the spaghetti sauce on the bottom of a 15x10-inch baking
                dish. Place shells, seam-side up, close together in the dish. Spread
                remaining sauce on top; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven 25 to 35 minutes until bubbly.
                Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
